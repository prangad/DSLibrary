# DSLibrary
A library containing four methods used in discrete structures. This consists of vertex coloring and degree sequences.

These methods were created for use in my discrete structures course.
These methods can provide vertex coloring for a graph, determine if a given vertex coloring is proper, determine the degree sequence of a graph, and determine whether or not a given degree sequence abides by the Erdos Gallai theorem.
